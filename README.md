## How to Run
Clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSJDeathSpawn/systems-design-site.git
```
in a directory/folder of your liking.

Install tailwind using:
```bash
npm install
```
(Make sure npm is installed before you run)

Make a virtual environment for python (Optional):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
```bash
./venv/bin/activate
```
Or in powershell:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally:
```bash
python main.py
```

Now pay attention to the command output,
you will see something like:

Paste that address into the browser or click on it if your terminal supports links
